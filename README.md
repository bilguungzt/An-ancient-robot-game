# Ancient_Game
For this project, you are given a program that implements a game where a human user tries to escape from four robots. The user and four robots are on an x-y grid. On every step, you enter a move for the human. The robots will attempt to get closer to the human.
When a robot has the same x-y coordinates as the human, the game is over. 

Two arrays x[4] and y[4] keep track of the x- and y-coordinates of four robots. The positions of the human and the four robots are initialized in the program. On each step, the user enters a move; the positions of the human and the robots are updated. This continues until the human dies.
